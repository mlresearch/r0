title: An Axiomatization of Loglinear Models with an Application to the Model-Search
  Problem
abstract: A good strategy to save computational time in a model-search problem consists
  in endowing the search procedure with a mechanism of logical inference, which sometimes
  allows an interaction model to be accepted or rejected without resorting to the
  numeric test. In principle, the best inferential mechanism should based on a sound
  and complete axiomatization of interaction models. We present a sound (and, probably
  incomplete) axiomatization which can be translated into a graphical inference procedure
  working with directed acyclic graphs.
