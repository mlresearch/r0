title: Picking the Best Expert from a Sequence
abstract: We examine the problem of finding a good expert from a sequence of experts.
  Each expert has an "error rate"; we wish to find an expert with a low error rate.
  However, each expertâ€™s error rate is unknown and can only be estimated by a sequence
  of experimental trials. Moreover, the distribution of error rates is also unknown.
  Given a bound on the total number of trials, there is thus a tradeoff between the
  number of experts examined and the accuracy of estimating their error rates.  We
  present a new expert-finding algorithm and prove an upper bound on the expected
  error rate of the expert found. A second approach, based on the sequential ratio
  test, gives another expert-finding algorithm that is not provably better but which
  performs better in our empirical studies.
