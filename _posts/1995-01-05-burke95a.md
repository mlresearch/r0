title: Comparing the Prediction Accuracy of Statistical Models and Artificial Neural
  Networks in Breast Cancer
abstract: 'Predicting survival is important in cancer because it determines patient
  therapy, it matches patients for clinical trials, and it provides information to
  the patient.  For over thirty years measuring cancer outcome has been based on the
  TNM Stage model. There are two problems with this model: (1) it is not very accurate
  (44% accurate for breast cancer), and (2) its accuracy can not be improved because
  predictive variables can not be added to the model without increasing the modelâ€™s
  complexity to the point where it is not longer useful to the clinician.  There are
  several statistical models that have the potential to replace the existing TNM Stage
  model. All of these models can integrate new prognostic factors to increase measurement
  accuracy. But they are not all equally accurate, and they do not all equally meet
  the criteria for a new prognostic system set by the American Joint Committee on
  Cancer (Burke HB, Henson DE. Criteria for prognostic factors and for an enhanced
  prognostic system. Cancer 1993 ; 72: 3131-5).  We compare the most powerful statistical
  models in terms of their accuracy in predicting five year breast cancer-specific
  survival. These models include principal component analysis, classification and
  regression tress both pruned and shrunk, stepwise logistic regression, and five
  types of artificial neural networks.'
