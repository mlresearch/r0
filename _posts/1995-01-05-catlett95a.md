title: Tailoring Rulesets to Misclassification Costs
abstract: 'This paper studies the capabilities obtained by modifying Quinlanâ€™s [9]
  C4.5 programs for inducing decision trees and rules to permit the specification
  of unequal misclassification costs for binary classification tasks. Setting this
  cost value allows important parameters such as the percentage classified as a given
  class to be moved over their complete range. In some applications such parameters
  require precise control, but a considerable degree of variation appears difficult
  to suppress, particularly with rules: it is present even in the unmodified versions
  that treat all errors as equal. Crossvalidation over a range of cost values seems
  the appropriate way to tune such parameters. Independent of misclassifications costs,
  the ability to explore a spectrum of classifiers can considerably assist exploratory
  data analysis, delivering clearer rules than the standard version may provide. These
  conclusions are illustrated on a simulated version of the game Blackjack.'
