title: Learning Possibilistic Networks from Data
abstract: We introduce a method for inducing the structure of (causal) possibilistic
  networks from databases of sample cases. In comparison to the construction of Bayesian
  belief networks, the proposed framework has some advantages, namely the explicit
  consideration of imprecise (set-valued) data, and the realization of a controlled
  form of information compression in order to increase the efficiency of the learning
  strategy as well as approximate reasoning using local propagation techniques.  Our
  learning method has been applied to reconstruct a non-singly connected network of
  22 nodes and 22 arcs without the need of any a priori supplied node ordering.
