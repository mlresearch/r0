title: A Comparative Evaluation of Sequential Feature Selection Algorithms
abstract: Several recent machine learning publications demonstrate the utility of
  using feature selection algorithms in supervised learning tasks. Among these, sequential
  feature selection algorithms are receiving attention. The most frequently studied
  variants of these algorithms are forward and backward sequential selection. Many
  studies on supervised learning with sequential feature selection report applications
  of these algorithms, but do not consider variants of them that might be more appropriate
  for some performance tasks. This paper reports positive empirical results on such
  variants, and argues for their serious consideration in similar learning tasks.
