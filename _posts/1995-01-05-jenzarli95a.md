title: Solving Influence Diagrams Using Gibbs Sampling
abstract: We describe a Monte Carlo method for solving influence diagrams. This method
  is a combination of stochastic dynamic programming and Gibbs sampling, an iterative
  Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Our method is especially useful when exact methods
  for solving influence diagrams fail.
