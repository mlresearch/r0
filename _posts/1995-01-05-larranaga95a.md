title: Structure Learning of Bayesian Networks by Hybrid Genetic Algorithms
abstract: This paper demonstrates how Genetic Algorithms can be used to discover the
  structure of a Bayesian Network from a given database with cases. The results presented,
  were obtained by applying four different types of Genetic Algorithms - SSGA (Steady
  State Genetic Algorithm), GAe $\lambda$ (Genetic Algorithm elistist of degree $\lambda$
  ), hSSGA (hybrid Steady State Genetic Algorithm) and the hGAe $\lambda$ (hybrid
  Genetic Algorithm elitist of degree $\lambda$ ) - to simulations of the ALARM Network.
  The behaviour of the mentioned algorithms is studied with respect to their parameters.
