title: Two Algorithms for Inducing Structural Equation Models from Data
abstract: We present two algorithms for inducing structural equation models from data.
  Assuming no latent variables, these models have a causal interpretation and their
  parameters may be estimated by linear multiple regression. Our algorithms are comparable
  with PC [15] and IC [12,11], which rely on conditional independence. We present
  the algorithms and empirical comparisons with $\mathrm{PC}$ and IC.
