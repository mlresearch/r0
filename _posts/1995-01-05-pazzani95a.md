title: Searching for Dependencies in Bayesian Classifiers
abstract: In this paper, we explore an alternate approach to determining whether it
  is useful to join two attributes when constructing a Bayesian classifier. We also
  give experimental results on parity functions, an artificial set of functions that
  are particularly difficult for naive Bayesian classifiers, and results on three
  naturally occurring data sets.
