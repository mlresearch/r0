title: Using Causal Knowledge to Learn More Useful Decision Rules From Data
abstract: One of the most popular and enduring paradigms in the intersection of machine-learning
  and computational statistics is the use of recursive-partitioning or "tree-structured"
  methods to "learn" classification trees from data sets [Buntine, 1993; Quinlan,
  1986]. This approach applies to independent variables of all scale types (binary,
  categorical, ordered categorical, and continuous) and to noisy as well as to noiseless
  training sets. It produces classification trees that can readily be reexpressed
  as sets of expert systems rules (with each conjunction of literals corresponding
  to a set of values for variables along one branch through the tree). Each such rule
  produces a probability vector for the possible classes (or dependent variable values)
  that the object being classified may have, thus automatically presenting confidence
  and uncertainty information about its conclusions. Classification trees can be validated
  by methods such as cross-validation (Breiman et al., 1984), and they can easily
  be modified to handle missing data by constructing rules that exploit only the information
  contained in the observed variables.
