title: Textual Data Mining
abstract: Most automated or semi-automated techniques for extracting novel information
  from data have concentrated on analyzing simple tables of numeric or atomic symbolic
  values. A related (but much more complex) problem, that of inferring new facts or
  knowledge from textual databases, has been addressed most effectively by the library
  and information retrieval research communities. This paper incorporates several
  ad hoc search strategies proposed by those communities into a single search methodology
  that guides the search process and provides a framework for the presentation of
  facts gleaned from the search. This graphical search result representation is semi-formal,
  in the sense that it represents the structure of search results formally while the
  contents of the search are represented informally. The methodology is intended as
  an aid to "mining" new scientific information from textual/bibliographic databases,
  rather than as an automated proof system.
