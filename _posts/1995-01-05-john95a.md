title: Robust Linear Discriminant Trees
abstract: 'We present a new method for the induction of classification trees with
  linear discriminants as the partitioning function at each internal node. This paper
  presents two main contributions: first, a novel objective function called soft entropy
  which is used to identify optimal coefficients for the linear discriminants, and
  second, a novel method for removing outliers called iter ative re-filtering which
  boosts performance on many datasets. These two ideas are presented in the context
  of a single learning algorithm called DT-SEPIR.'
