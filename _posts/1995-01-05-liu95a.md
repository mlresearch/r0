title: Propagation of Gaussian Belief Functions
abstract: Gaussian belief functions are represented in both variable space and configuration
  space. Their combinations are defined in terms of the Dempsterâ€™s rule, sweep operators,
  and restrictions in configuration space. The equivalence of the alternative definitions
  is proved. The computation of Gaussian belief functions is shown to follow the Shafer-Shenoy
  axioms.
