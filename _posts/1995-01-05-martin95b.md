title: An Exact Probability Metric for Decision Tree Splitting and Stopping
abstract: ID3â€™s information gain heuristic [16] is well-known to be biased towards
  multi-valued attributes. This bias is only partially compensated by the gain ratio
  used in C4.5 [20]. Several alternatives have been proposed, notably orthogonality
  [9], and Beta [5]. Gain ratio and orthogonality are strongly correlated, and all
  of the metrics share a common bias towards splits with one or more small expected
  values, under circumstances where the split likely ocurred by chance. Both classical
  and Bayesian statistics lead to the multiple hypergeometric distribution as the
  posterior probability of the null hypothesis. Both gain and the chi-squared significance
  test are shown to arise in asymptotic approximations to the hypergeometric, revealing
  similar criteria for admissibility and showing the nature of their biases. Previous
  failures to find admissible stopping rules in CART [3, pp 59-66] and ID3 [20, pp
  36-37] are traced to coupling these biased approximations with one another or with
  arbitrary thresholds; problems which are overcome by the hypergeometric. Empirical
  results show that pre-pruning should be done, as trees pruned in this way are simpler,
  more efficient, and no less accurate than unpruned trees. Average training time
  is reduced by up to $30 %$, and expensive post-pruning avoided.
