title: A Decision-Based View of Causality
abstract: We present a precise definition of cause and effect in terms of a more fundamental
  notion called unresponsiveness. Our definition departs from the traditional view
  of causation in that our causal assertions are made relative to a set of decisions.
  An important consequence of this departure is that we can reason about cause locally,
  not necessarily attaching a causal explanation to every dependency. Such local reasoning
  can be beneficial in that, given a set of real decisions to make, it may not be
  necessary to determine whether some dependencies are causal. Also in this paper,
  we examine the graphical encoding of causal relationships. We show that ordinary
  influence diagrams are an inadequate representation of cause, whereas influence
  diagrams in Howard Canonical Form can always represent cause and effect accurately.
  In addition, we establish a correspondence between Pearl and Vermaâ€™s (1991) causal
  model and the influence diagram.
