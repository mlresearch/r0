title: Which method learns most from the data? Methodological Issues in the Analysis
  of Comparative Studies
abstract: The mutual discovery of the statistical and artificial intelligence communities
  (see e.g. [Han93, CO94]) has resulted in many studies which compare the performance
  of statistical and machine learning methods on empirical data sets; examples are
  the StatLog project ([MST94]) and the Santa Fe Time Series Competition ([WG94]),
  as well as numerous journal articles ([KWR93, RABCK93, WHR90, TAF91, TK92, FG93]).  What
  has struck us is the casual manner comparisons are typically carried out in the
  literature. The ranking of $k$ preselected methods is performed by training (estimating
  in statistical terminology) them on a single data set, and estimating their respective
  mean prediction errors (MPE) from a hold-out sample. The methods are, subsequently,
  ranked according to their estimated MPEs. When the total number of observations
  is small, usually cross-validation rather than a hold-out sample is used to estimate
  the mean prediction errors.  A more rigourous comparison of methods should include
  significance testing rather than giving a mere ranking based on the estimated MPEs.
  The statistical analysis of comparative studies, method ranking in particular, is
  addressed in this paper. Specifically, we address methodological issues of studies
  in which the performance of several regression or classification methods is compared
  on empirical data sets.
