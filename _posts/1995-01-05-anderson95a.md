title: Tools for Empirically Analyzing AI Programs
abstract: The paper describes two separate but synergistic tools for running experiments
  on large Lisp systems such as Artificial Intelligence planning systems, by which
  we mean systems that produce plans and execute them in some kind of simulator. The
  first tool, called CLIP (Common Lisp Instrumentation Package), allows the researcher
  to define and run experiments, including experimental conditions (parameter values
  of the planner or simulator) and data to be collected. The data are written out
  to data files that can be analyzed by statistics software. The second tool, called
  CLASP (Common Lisp Analytical Statistics Package), allows the researcher to analyze
  data from experiments by using graphics, statistical tests, and various kinds of
  data manipulation. CLASP has a graphical user interface (using CLIM, the Common
  Lisp Interface Manager, Version 2.0) and also allows data to be directly processed
  by Lisp functions. CLIP and CLASP form the foundation of a larger set of specialized
  tools we are building for the empirical analysis of AI programs.
