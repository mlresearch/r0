title: On Graphical Models for Dynamic Systems
abstract: It is widely recognized that probabilistic graphical models provide a good
  framework for both knowledge representation and probabilistic inference (e.g., see
  [2],[14]). The dynamic behaviour of a system which changes over the time needs an
  implicit or explicit time representation. In this paper, an implicit time representation
  using dynamic graphical models is proposed. Our goal is to model the state of a
  system and its evolution over the time in a richer and more natural way than other
  approaches together with a more suitable treatment of the inference on variables
  of interest.
