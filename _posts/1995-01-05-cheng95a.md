title: Analysis and Application of the Generalized Mean-Shift Process
abstract: The mean shift process repeatedly moves each data point to the mean of data
  points in its neighborhood. This process is generalized and analyzed. Its relation
  with maximum-entropy and $\mathrm{K}$-means clustering methods is studied. Its nature
  of gradient mapping is revealed. Its applications in clustering, Hough transform,
  and overfitting relaxation are examined.
