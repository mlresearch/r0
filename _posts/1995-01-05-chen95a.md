title: 'Predicting Stock Returns with Genetic Programming: Do the Short-Term Nonlinear
  Regularities Exist?'
abstract: This paper is devoted to applying the genetic programming paradigm to the
  test of the captial market efficiency hypothesis. How this paradigm is distinguished
  from the existing statistical approaches is briefly reviewed. Instead of using the
  large-sample analysis prevailing in the literature, this research rests on a small-sample
  analysis to inquire the existence of short-term non-linear regularities. By Rissanen’s
  MDLP (Minimum Description Length Principle), the sample period with the highest
  complexity is chosen. Since our simulation results, which are based on Koza’s genetic
  programming paradigm (KGP) and its Bayesian modification (BGP), show that it is
  not easy to outperform $A R(1)$ and is extremely difficult to beat random walk,
  the nonlinear regularities, while might exist, is very difficult to be found. Therefore,
  the capital market efficiency hypothesis can, at least, sustain from this perspective.
