title: Truncated Gaussians as Tolerance Sets
abstract: 'This work presents a new class of statistical models that are well suited
  for several Robotics applications, such as object recognition or computer vision.
  Our approach deals with bounded data: measurements that are constrained to appear
  in a bounded region in the measurement space. The literature refers to the set where
  the measurement can appear as the tolerance set for the measurement. To date, few
  statistical models for bounded variables are used in Artificial Intelligence. The
  most common model is the uniform distribution, but this approach has several drawbacks:
  summation of uniform variables does not yield a uniform variable and application
  of Bayes rule is computationally intensive [9]. Another approach is to use the Gaussian
  distribution and model bounds through an ad hoc selection mechanism [1, 2]. In short,
  even though bounds contain significant information, they have not yet received proper
  attention.'
