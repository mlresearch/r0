title: 'Omega-Stat: An Environment for Implementing Intelligent Modeling Strategies'
abstract: Omega-Stat is a new statistical environment built on Lisp-Stat, an object-oriented
  statistical programming environment. It contains extensible, reusable-component
  libraries for performing data management, multivariate analyses, modeling, and dynamic
  graphics. The point-and-click user interface allows instant access to all objects,
  including analysis and graphics objects comprising a semantic map. Knowledge, and
  methods for accessing this knowledge, are embedded within model objects and edge
  objects linking these models. This will allow the modeling process to be studied
  by following the analysis trails of expert analysts. The objective is to provide
  an "expert consultant" that is accessible as part of the man/machine interaction.
  Modeling strategies can then be built into Omega-Stat by using prior knowledge and
  data-analytic heuristics to guide the process of constructing the model tree and
  the iterative search for an "optimal" model.
