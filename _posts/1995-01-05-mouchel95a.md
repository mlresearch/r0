title: Two Applications of Statistical Modelling to Natural Language Processing
abstract: Each week the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center collects several megabytes
  of English text transcribed from radiologistsâ€™ dictation and notes of their interpretations
  of medical diagnostic x-rays. It is desired to automate the extraction of diagnoses
  from these natural language reports. This paper reports on two aspects of this project
  requiring advanced statistical methods. First, the identification of pairs of words
  and phrases that tend to appear together (collocate) uses a hierarchical Bayesian
  model that adjusts to different word and word pair distributions in different bodies
  of text. Second, we present an analysis of data from experiments to compare the
  performance of the computer diagnostic program to that of a panel of physician and
  lay readers of randomly sampled texts. A measure of inter-subject distance with
  respect to the diagnoses is defined for which estimated variances and covariances
  are easily computed. This allows statistical conclusions about the similarities
  and dissimilarities among diagnoses by the various programs and experts.
