title: Causal Discovery from Data in the Presence of Selection Bias
abstract: Recent research advances have made it possible to consider using observational
  data to infer causal relationships among measured variables. Selection bias results
  from the observation of entities that are not representative of the entities that
  are generated by a causal process of interest. This paper shows that we can sometimes
  detect the presence of selection bias in observational data. The paper also demonstrates
  how selection bias can hinder the discovery of causal relationships from observational
  data. As we will describe, the use of experimental data (e.g., data from randomized,
  controlled trials) to discover causal relationships can be susceptible as well to
  problems involving selection bias. We offer suggestions for how to proceed with
  causal discovery in the face of selection bias.
