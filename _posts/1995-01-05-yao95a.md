title: Likelihood-based Causal Inference
abstract: A method is given which uses subject matter assumptions to discriminate
  recursive models and thus point toward possible causal explanations. The assumptions
  alone do not specify any order among the variables - rather just a theoretical absence
  of direct association. We show how these assumptions, while not specifying any ordering,
  can when combined with the data through the likelihood function yield information
  about an underlying recursive order. We derive details of the method for multinormal
  random variables and apply the procedure to a simulated example.
