title: Missing Data Models as Meta-Data
abstrac: 'Missing data are ubiquitous. The common practice is to throw away those
  parts of the data which have missing values. This practice not only wastes information,
  but may also lead to biased inferences unless the data are missing completely at
  random, i.e., the subjects with complete data are a simple random sample of all
  of the subjects in the data set. Examples where this assumption breaks down are
  numerous. In surveys, for example, wealthy people may be most likely to skip questions
  about income. To go beyond simply omitting missing values, the computer requires
  an explicit model for the missing values, using information from either external
  sources or the completely observed data. These missing data models are meta-data
  about the variables. Given the missing data model, standard analysis procedures
  should adapt themselves to properly account for the missing data. This paper describes
  our prototype representation of missing data meta-data in the S-PLUS language.  First,
  this paper briefly describes two model based methods for analyzing missing data:
  multiple imputation and the Expectation-Maximation (EM) algorithm. Next, we review
  the current model for S-PLUS analysis in the framework described by Anglin and Oldford[1994].
  We then extend that model to cover analysis with missing data and describe our progress
  in implementing this model.'
