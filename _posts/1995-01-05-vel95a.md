title: 'Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction: A Comparative Performance Analysis'
abstract: We present an analysis of the comparative performance of non-linear dimensionality
  reduction methods such as Non-Linear Mapping, NonMetric Multidimensional Scaling
  and the Kohonen Self-Organising Feature Map for which data sets of different dimensions
  are used. To obtain comparative measures of how well the mapping is performed, Procrustes
  analysis, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and the scatter-plot diagram
  are used. Results indicate that, in low dimensions, Non-Linear Mapping has the best
  performance especially when measured in terms of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
  The output from the Kohonen SelfOrganising Feature Map is easier to interpret than
  the output from the other methods as it often provides a superior qualitative visual
  output. Also, the Kohonen Self-Organising Feature Map may outperform the other methods
  in a high-dimensional setting.
