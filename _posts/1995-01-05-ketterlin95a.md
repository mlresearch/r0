title: Hierarchical Clustering of Composite Objects with a Variable Number of Components
abstract: This paper examines the problem of clustering a sequence of objects that
  cannot be described with a predefined list of attributes (or variables). In many
  applications, such a crisp representation cannot be determined. An extension of
  the traditionnal propositionnal formalism is thus proposed, which allows objects
  to be represented as a set of components. The algorithm used for clustering is briefly
  illustrated, and mechanisms to handle sets are described. Some empirical evaluations
  are also provided, to assess the validity of the approach.
