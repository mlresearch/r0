title: Learning in Hybrid Noise Environments Using Statistical Queries
abstract: We consider theoretical models of learning from noisy data. Specifically,
  we focus on learning in the probability approximately correct model as defined by
  Valiant. Two of the most widely studied models of noise in this setting have been
  classification noise and malicious errors. However, a more realistic model combining
  the two types of noise has not been formalized. We define a learning environment
  based on a natural combination of these two noise models. We first show that hypothesis
  testing is possible in this model. We next describe a simple technique for learning
  in this model, and then describe a more powerful technique based on statistical
  query learning. We show that the noise tolerance of this improved technique is roughly
  optimal with respect to the tolerance of the statistical query algorithm and that
  it provides a smooth tradeoff between the tolerable amounts of the two types of
  noise. Finally, we show that statistical query simulation yields learning algorithms
  for other combinations of noise models, thus demonstrating that statistical query
  specification truly captures the generic fault tolerance of a learning algorithm.
