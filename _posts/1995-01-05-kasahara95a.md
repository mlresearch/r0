title: Viewpoint-Based Measurement of Semantic Similarity between Words
abstract: A method of measuring semantic similarity between words using a knowledgebase
  constructed automatically from machine-readable dictionaries is proposed. The method
  takes into consideration the fact that similarity changes depending on situation
  or context, which we call ’viewpoint’. A feature of the method is that certain parts
  of the overall concept of words, compared with each other, are emphasized by using
  the viewpoint when calculating the degree of similarity. Evaluation shows the proposed
  method, although based on a simply structured knowledge-base, is superior to other
  currently available methods.
