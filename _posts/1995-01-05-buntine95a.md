title: Software for Data Analysis with Graphical Models
abstract: 'Probabilistic graphical models are being used widely in artificial intelligence
  and statistics, for instance, in diagnosis and expert systems, as a framework for
  representing and reasoning with probabilities and independencies. They come with
  corresponding algorithms for performing statistical inference. This offers a unifying
  framework for prototyping and/or generating data analysis algorithms from graphical
  specifications. This paper illustrates the framework with an example and then presents
  some basic techniques for the task: problem decomposition and the calculation of
  exact Bayes factors. Other tools already developed, such as automatic differentiation,
  Gibbs sampling, and use of the EM algorithm, make this a broad basis for the generation
  of data analysis software.'
