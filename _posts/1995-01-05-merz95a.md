title: Dynamical Learning Bias Selection
abstract: Determining the conditions for which a given learning algorithm is appropriate
  is an open problem in machine learning. Methods for selecting a learning algorithm
  for a given domain or for a portion of the domain have met with limited success.
  This paper proposes a new approach to predicting a given exampleâ€™s class by locating
  it in the "example space" and then choosing the best learner(s) in that region of
  the example space to make predictions. The regions of the example space are defined
  by the prediction patterns of the learners being used. The learner(s) chosen for
  prediction are selected according to their past performance in that region. This
  dynamic approach to learning bias selection is compared to other methods for selecting
  from multiple learning algorithms.
