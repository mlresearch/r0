title: Combining Statistics and AI in the Optimization of Semiconductors for Solar
  Cells
abstract: In the framework of a research project in photovoltaics, a flexible method
  of parameter optimization is developed. Target of the optimization is the quality
  of semiconductor materials for solar cells. The quality depends on the parameter
  values chosen for the semiconductor production process. The optimization method
  is based on the combined application of statistics and artificial intelligence.
  Experiment design is used to collect and analyze experimental data from the process
  in order to acquire knowledge about the relationship between parameter values and
  semiconductor quality. Classifiers built by machine learning algorithms help to
  determine semiconductor quality by the inspection of special signals obtainable
  from the running process. A final on-line hillclimbing search for optimal parameter
  values is guided by both the classifier and the knowledge about process behaviour
  derived from previous experiments.
