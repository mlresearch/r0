title: Control Representation in an EDA Assistant
abstract: "  While research in statistics and artificial intelligence has addressed
  issues in the automation of later stages of analysis, such as theory generation,
  model selection, and experiment design [23], less attention has been given to initial
  exploration of data. We have developed a novel approach to exploration as search.
  This paper gives an overview of the design of AIDE, the Assistant for Intelligent
  Data Exploration, which assists humans in the early stages of data analysis [1].
  The system adopts a script-based planning approach to automating EDA. Data-directed
  mechanisms extract simple observations and suggestive indications from the data.
  Scripted EDA operations are then applied in goal-directed fashion to generate deeper
  descriptions of the data. Control rules guide the EDA operations, relying on intermediate
  results for their decisions. The system is mixed-initiative, capable of autonomously
  pursuing high and low level goals while still allowing the user to guide or override
  its decisions. AIDE is currently a prototype under development. We emphasize that
  the work presented here is incomplete."
