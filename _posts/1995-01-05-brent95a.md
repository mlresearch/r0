title: Discovering Morphemic Suffixes A Case Study In MDL Induction
abstract: This paper reports experiments in the automatic discovery of linguistically
  significant regularities in text. The minimum description length principle is exploited
  to evaluate linguistic hypotheses with respect to a corpus and a theory of the types
  of regularities to be found in it. The domain of inquiry in this paper is the discovery
  of morphemic suffixes such as English -ing and -ly, but the technique is widely
  applicable to language learning problems.
