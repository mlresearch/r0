title: Classifying New Words for Robust Parsing
abstract: Robust natural language parsing systems must be able to handle words that
  are not in their lexicons. This paper describes a statistical classifier that determines
  the most likely parts of speech of new words. The classifier uses a loglinear model
  to obtain smoothed conditional probabilities that take into account the interactions
  between different features. We show accuracy results for this model, and compare
  it to some simpler methods.
