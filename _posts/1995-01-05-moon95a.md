title: Modeling Life Time Data by Neural Networks
abstract: With the advancement of sophisticated computer programs, much of the data
  analysis process such as graph drawing, hypothesis testing, and construction of
  interval estimates can be automated. One exception is the process of interpreting
  graphical data, which is still being done by trained statisticians. The efforts
  of computerizing the interpretation process of graphical data must address at least
  two issues. First, we need to incorporate the flexibility of trained statisticians.
  Second, we need to incorporate desirable subjectivity of experienced statisticians.
  This paper presents a method which automates the process of graphical analysis using
  neural networks trained by the Back-propagation learning rule. Two case studies
  were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. Particularly, the empirical
  case study has demonstrated the effectiveness of the neural network approach.
