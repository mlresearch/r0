title: Detecting Imperfect Patterns in Event Streams Using Local Search
abstract: The problem of inferring causality from empirical observations has been
  well studied. Several approaches are notable for efficiently constructing complex
  causal models of the inter-relationships between variables ( e.g.,[8,3,2]). These
  approaches tend to rely on correlations and co-variances among the variables as
  the basis for inferring causality. However, for some applications, the available
  data are categorical observations over time (e.g., event streams or execution traces
  of programs); for example, patterns in execution traces form the basis of several
  methods of debugging software (e.g., [1,4]). These applications are less amenable
  to solution by methods based on correlation and co-variance. An alternative approach,
  called Dependency Detection, searches the event streams for often recurring sequences
  [6]. The set of recurring sequences (called dependencies) indicates events that
  commonly co-occur and forms a weak model of causality. Although promising, dependency
  detection is limited in several ways. First, the underlying search is exhaustive,
  looking for all possible dependencies in the data. As a consequence, the computational
  complexity increases exponentially with the length of the sequences. Second, the
  sequences are rigid, which means that only exact matches count and that any noise
  (i.e., insertion of some other unrelated event into the stream) will not count as
  an example of the sequence. Third, the technique considers only a single stream
  rather than multiple streams of parallel events; Oates et al. have developed a technique
  for multi-stream dependency detection [7]. This paper describes how local search
  with flexible matching has been used to overcome the first two limitations.
