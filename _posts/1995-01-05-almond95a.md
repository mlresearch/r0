title: Hypergraph Grammars for Knowledge Based Model Construction
abstract: Graphical belief networks, including Bayes nets and influence diagrams,
  can be represented with directed hypergraphs. Each directed hyperedge corresponds
  to a factor of the joint distribution of all variables in the model. A hyperedge
  replacement grammar is a collection of rules for replacing hyperedges with hypergraphs.
  A hyperedge replacement grammar for graphical belief networks defines a collection
  of graphical belief models.  Hyperedge replacement grammars have several interesting
  implications in the construction of graphical models. (1) They provide a way to
  represent the process of constructing a graphical model. (2) Coupled with an object-oriented
  variable type system, provide a convenient method for searching through candidate
  factors to fill a particular slot in the model graph. (3) They provide a method
  for integrating high-level and detailed views of a graphical model. (4) They provide
  a mechanism for representing uncertainty about the model structure.
