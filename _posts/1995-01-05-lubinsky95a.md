title: Tree Structured Interpretable Regression
abstract: 'We describe a new method of regression closely related to the regression
  ideas CART. which has the following potential advantages over traditional methods:
  the method can naturally be applied to very large datasets in which only a small
  proportion of the predictors are useful, the resulting regression rules are more
  easily interpreted and applied, and may be more accurate in application, since the
  rules are derived by means of a crossvalidation technique which maximizes their
  predictive accuracy. The system is evaluated in an empirical study and compared
  to traditional regression and CART systems.'
