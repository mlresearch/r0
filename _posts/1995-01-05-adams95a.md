title: Part-of-Speech Tagging from "Small" Data Sets
abstract: Many probabilistic approaches to part-of-speech (POS) tagging compile statistics
  from massive corpora such as the LOB. Using the hidden Markov model method on a
  900,000 token training corpus, it is not difficult achieve a success rate of 95
  per cent on a 100,000 token test corpus. However, even such large training corpora
  contain few relatively few words. For example, the LOB contains about 45,000 words,
  most of which occur only once or twice. As a result, 3-4 per cent of tokens in the
  test corpus are unseen and cause a significant proportion of errors. A corpus large
  enough to accurately represent all possible tag sequences seems implausible enough,
  let alone a corpus that also represents, even in small numbers, enough of English
  to make the problem of unseen words insignificant. This work argues this may not
  be necessary, describing variations on HMM-based tagging that facilitate learning
  from relatively little data, including ending-based approaches, incremental learning
  strategies, and the use of approximate distributions.
