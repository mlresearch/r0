title: Statistical Preprocessing for Decision Tree Induction
abstract: Some apparently simple numeric data sets cause significant problems for
  existing decision tree induction algorithms, in that no method is able to find a
  small, accurate tree, even though one exists. One source of this difficulty is the
  goodness measures used to decide whether a particular node represents a good way
  to split the data. This paper points out that the commonly-used goodness measures
  are not equipped to take into account some patterns in numeric attribute spaces,
  and presents a framework for capturing some such patterns into decision tree induction.
  As a case study, it is demonstrated empirically that supervised clustering, when
  used as a preprocessing step, can improve the quality of both univariate and multivariate
  decision trees.
