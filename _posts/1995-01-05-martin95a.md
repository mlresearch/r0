title: 'Evaluating and Comparing Classifiers: Complexity Measures'
abstract: 'Relevant literature on Kolmogorov complexity measures and on trade-offs
  of classifier accuracy for reduced complexity is reviewed, seeking a pragmatic methodology
  for the practising applications analyst. Significant findings are that: (1) An accuracy/complexity
  trade-off is desirable; (2) Combined measures of accuracy/complexity are not practical
  due to difficulties encoding constraint satisfication, lack of sampling statistics
  and suitable tests of the null hypothesis, and practical difficulties of encoding
  complex functions and encoding across families of classifiers; (3) Therefore, a
  generalized version of the CART [5] 1-SE rule is recommended; (4) Kolmogorov complexity
  is not practically computable (see (2)); and, therefore, (6) Simply measuring response
  times on a target environment is the recommended measure of complexity.'
