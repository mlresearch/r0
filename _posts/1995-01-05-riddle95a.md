title: Framework for a Generic Knowledge Discovery Toolkit
abstract: 'Industrial and commercial firms accumulate vast quantities of data in the
  course of their day-today business. The primary use of this data is to monitor business
  processes: inventory, maintenance actions, and so on. However this data contains
  much valuable information that, if accessible, would enhance the understanding of,
  and aid in improving the performance of, the processes being monitored. Traditional
  statistical procedures provide some insight into this data, but they are often misused
  in non-expert hands. With the rapidly increasing quantity of data, it is no longer
  cost effective for trained statisticians to analyze all the data. The number of
  variables and observations in these datasets is often very large, and the number
  of candidate statistical models that might be considered is too large to permit
  manual systematic exploration. In this type of situation, a Knowledge Discovery
  (KD) tool is the most effective way to explore the data.'
