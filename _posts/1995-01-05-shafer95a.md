title: A Generalization of the Tetrad Representation Theorem
abstract: The tetrad representation theorem, due to Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines
  (1993), gives a graphical condition necessary and sufficient for the vanishing of
  an individual tetrad difference in a linear structural equation model. In this paper,
  we generalize their result from individual tetrad differences to sets of tetrad
  differences of a certain form, and we simplify their proof. The generalization allows
  tighter constraints to be placed on the set of linear models compatible with given
  data and thereby facilitates the search for parsimonious models for large data sets.
