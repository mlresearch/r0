title: 'Ploxoma: Testbed for Uncertain Inference'
abstract: This paper compares two formalisms for uncertain inference, Kyburg’s Combinatorial
  Semantics and Dempster-Shafer belief function theory, on the basis of an example
  from the domain of medical diagnosis. I review Shafer’s example about the imaginary
  disease ploxoma and show how it would be represented in Combinatorial Semantics.
  I conclude that belief function theory has a qualitative advantage because it offers
  greater flexibility of expression, and provides results about more specific classes
  of patients. Nevertheless, a quantitative comparison reveals that the inferences
  sanctioned by Combinatorial Semantics are more reliable than those of belief function
  theory.
