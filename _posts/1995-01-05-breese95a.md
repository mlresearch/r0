title: Decision-Theoretic Case-Based Reasoning
abstract: We describe a decision-theoretic methodology for case-based reasoning in
  diagnosis and troubleshooting applications. The system utilizes a special-structure
  belief network to represent diagnostic cases, with nodes representing issues, causes,
  and symptoms. Dirichlet distributions are assessed at knowledge acquisition time
  to indicate the strength of relationships between variables. During a diagnosis
  session, a relevant subnetwork is extracted from a belief-network database that
  describes a very large number of diagnostic interactions and cases. The constructed
  network is used to make recommendations regarding possible repairs and additional
  observations, based on an estimate of expected repair costs. As cases are resolved,
  observations of issues, causes, symptoms, and the success of repairs are recorded.
  New variables are added to the database, and the probabilities associated with variables
  already in the database are updated. In this way, the inferential behavior of system
  adjusts to the characteristics of the target population of users. We show how these
  elements work together in a cycle of troubleshooting tasks, and describe some results
  from a pilot system implementation and deployment.
