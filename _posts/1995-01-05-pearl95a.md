title: A Causal Calculus for Statistical Research
abstract: 'Many statisticians are reluctant to deal with problems involving causal
  considerations because we lack the mathematical notation for distinguishing causal
  influence from statistical association. To address this problem, a notation is proposed
  that admits two conditioning operators: ordinary Bayes conditioning, $P(y \mid X=x)$,
  and causal conditioning, $P(y \mid \operatorname{set}(X=x))$, that is, conditioning
  $P(y)$ on holding $X$ constant (at $x)$ by external intervention. This distinction,
  which will be supported by three rules of inference, will permit us to derive probability
  expressions for the combined effect of observations and interventions. The resulting
  calculus yields simple solutions to a number of interesting problems in causal inference
  and should allow rank-and-file researchers to tackle practical problems that are
  generally considered too hard, or impossible. Examples are: 1. Deciding whether
  the information available in a given observational study is sufficient for obtaining
  consistent estimates of causal effects. 2. Deriving algebraic expressions for causal
  effect estimands. 3. Selecting measurements that would render randomized experiments
  unnecessary. 4. Selecting a set of indirect (randomized) experiments to replace
  direct experiments that are either infeasible or too expensive. 5. Predicting (or
  bounding) the efficacy of treatments from randomized trials with imperfect compliance.
  Starting with nonparametric specification of structural equations, the paper establishes
  the semantics necessary for a theory of interventions, presents the three rules
  of inference, demonstrates the use of the resulting calculus on a number of examples,
  and establishes an operational definition of structural equations.'
