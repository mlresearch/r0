title: Abductive Reasoning in Bayesian Belief Networks Using a Genetic Algorithm
abstract: Bayesian belief networks (causal networks) have been extensively studied
  in the past ten years. It has been shown that they provide a sound formalism for
  probabilistic reasoning, especially if uncertainty is to be represented. A probability
  space can be modelled as a Bayesian belief network of propositional variables (nodes)
  which may be pairwise connected by directed arcs. The interpretation is that if
  an arc exists from node A to node $B$, the probability of node $B$ assuming a given
  state $b_{i}$ depends on the actual state of node $A$ ( $A$ is a direct cause of
  $B$ ). The absence of an arc between two nodes implies that there is no such direct
  dependence. Thus, in a Bayesian belief network, probabilistic dependencies are modelled
  as arcs between nodes, independencies are implied by the absence of arcs. If for
  a given probability space, for all states of the root nodes the prior probabilities
  are known, and in addition, for all non-root nodes the conditional probabilities,
  given the parent states, the joint probability distribution is completely known.
  Textbooks on Bayesian belief networks are [1] and [2].
