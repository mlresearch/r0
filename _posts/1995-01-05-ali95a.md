title: Learning Multiple Relational Rule-based Models
abstract: We present a method for learning multiple relational models for each class
  in the data. Bayesian probability theory offers an optimal strategy for combining
  classifications of the individual concept descriptions. Here we use a tractable
  approximation to that theory. Previous work in learning multiple models has been
  in the attribute-value realm. We show that stochastically learning multiple relational
  (first-order) models consisting of a ruleset for each class also yields gains in
  accuracy when compared to the accuracy of a single deterministically learned relational
  model. In addition we show that learning multiple models is most helpful when the
  hypothesis space is "flat" with respect to the gain metric used in learning.
