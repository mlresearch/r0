title: On Test Selection Strategies for Belief Networks
abstract: Decision making under uncertainty typically requires an iterative process
  of information acquisition. At each stage, the decision maker chooses the next best
  test (or tests) to perform, and re-evaluates the possible decisions. Value-of-information
  analyses provide a formal strategy for selecting the next test(s). However, the
  complete decision-theoretic approach is impractical and researchers have sought
  approximations. In this paper, we present strategies for both myopic and limited
  non-myopic (working with known test groups) test selection in the context of belief
  networks. We focus primarily on utility-free test selection strategies. However,
  the methods have immediate application to the decision-theoretic framework.
