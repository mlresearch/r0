title: Data Representations in Learning
abstract: This paper examines the effect of varying the coarse-ness (or fine-ness)
  in a data representation upon the learning or recognition accuracy achievable. This
  accuracy is quantified by the least probability of error in recognition also known
  as the Bayes error rate, assuming that there are finite number of classes into which
  each data element can be classified. By modeling the granularity variation of the
  representation as a refinement of the underlying probability structure of the data,
  we examine how the recognition accuracy varies. Specifically, refining the data
  representation leads to improved bounds on the probability of error. Indeed, this
  confirms the intuitive notion that more information can lead to improved decision-making.
  This analysis may be extended to multiresolution methods where coarse-to-fine and
  fine-to-coarse variations in representations are possible. Our research was motivated
  by examining the change in the recognition accuracy of $k$-nearest neighbor classifiers
  while the resolution of the data - optical character images - is varied. In this
  domain, the data resolution is crucial in determining trade-offs in the speed and
  accuracy of the OCR system.
