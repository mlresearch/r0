title: A Hill-Climbing Approach to Construct Near-Optimal Decision Trees
abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the state of an $n$ component coherent
  system, where each component can be working or failed. It is costly to determine
  the states of the components. The goal is to find a decision tree which specifies
  the order of the components to be tested with minimum expected cost. The problem
  is known to be NP-hard. We present an extremely promising heuristic method for creating
  effective decision trees, and computational results show that the method obtains
  optimal solutions for $95 %$ of the cases tested.
