title: Forrest W. Young and David J. Lubinsky
abstract: 'The concept of statistical strategy is introduced and used to develop a
  structured graphical user interface for guiding data analysts so that they can learn
  about the structure of their data. The interface visually represents statistical
  strategies that are designed by expert data analysts to guide novices. The representation
  is an abstraction of the expert’s concepts of the essence of a data analysis. The
  interface consists of two interacting windows: the guidemap and the workmap. An
  example is shown in Figure 1 (a screen image from UiSta (Young, 1994), software
  that implements the ideas in this paper).Each window contains a graph which has
  nodes and edges. The guidemap graph represents the statistical strategy for a specific
  statistical task (such as describing data). Nodes represent potential data-analysis
  actions that can be taken by the system. Edges represent potential actions that
  can be taken by the analyst. The guidemap graph exists prior to the data-analysis
  session, having been created by an expert. The workmap graph represents the complete
  history of all steps taken by the data analyst. It is constructed during the data-analysis
  session as a result of the analyst’s actions. Workmap nodes represent datasets,
  data models, or data-analysis procedures which have been created or used by the
  analyst. Workmap edges represent the chronological sequence of the analyst’s actions.
  One workmap node is highlighted to show which statistical object is the focus of
  the strategy.'
