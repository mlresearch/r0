title: Representing and Solving Asymmetric Decision Problems Using Valuation Networks
abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of valuation networks to represent
  and solve asymmetric decision problems. The structural asymmetry information is
  represented by indicator valuations. An indicator valuation is a special type of
  a probability valuation whose values are restricted to either 0 or 1 . Indicator
  valuations enable us to reduce the domain of probability valuations and this contributes
  greatly to improving the computational efficiency of the solution technique. We
  use indicator valuations to define effective frames as subsets of frames of variables.
  All numeric information is specified only for effective frames. The solution technique
  is mostly the same as in the symmetric case. The main difference is that all computations
  are done on the effective frames of variables. This contributes to the increased
  efficiency of the solution technique. Also, when restricted to effective frames,
  the values of indicator valuations are identically one, and therefore indicator
  valuations can be handled implicitly and this contributes further to the increased
  efficiency of the solution technique.
