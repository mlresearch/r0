title: Detecting Complex Dependencies in Categorical Data
abstract: 'Locating and evaluating relationships among values in multiple streams
  of data is a difficult and important task. Consider the data flowing from monitors
  in an intensive care unit. Readings from various subsets of the monitors are indicative
  and predictive of certain aspects of the patient’s state. We present an algorithm
  that facilitates discovery and assessment of the strength of such predictive relationships
  called Multi-stream Dependency Detection (MSDD). We use heuristic search to guide
  our exploration of the space of potentially interesting dependencies to uncover
  those that are significant. We begin by reviewing the dependency detection technique
  described in [3], and extend it to the multiple stream case, describing in detail
  our heuristic search over the space of possible dependencies. Quantitative evidence
  for the utility of our approach is provided through a series of experiments with
  artificially-generated data. In addition, we present results from the application
  of our algorithm to two real problem domains: feature-based classification and prediction
  of pathologies in a simulated shipping network.'
