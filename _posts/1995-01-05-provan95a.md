title: Learning Bayesian Networks Using Feature Selection
abstract: This paper introduces a novel enhancement for learning Bayesian networks
  with a bias for small, high-predictive-accuracy networks. The new approach selects
  a subset of features which maximizes predictive accuracy prior to the network learning
  phase. We examine explicitly the effects of two aspects of the algorithm, feature
  selection and node ordering. Our approach generates networks which are computationally
  simpler to evaluate and which display predictive accuracy comparable to that of
  Bayesian networks which model all attributes.
